Guided Discovery & Problem Framing Module:
Industry/Function Specific Questionnaires: Pre-built sets of questions tailored to different industries (e.g., Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Manufacturing) and business functions (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Operations, HR).
Pain Point Identification Frameworks: Tools to help reps probe for specific challenges, inefficiencies, unmet goals, or strategic objectives (e.g., using frameworks like "Jobs to be Done," "5 Whys").
Business Objective Mapping: Functionality to link identified pain points directly to the client's stated strategic goals or KPIs.
Current State Assessment: Prompts and templates to document the client's existing processes, systems, data sources, and associated costs or limitations related to the identified problem area.
AI Opportunity Identification & Ideation Module:
Use Case Library: A searchable, filterable database of common AI use cases relevant to your service offerings (e.g., Predictive Maintenance, Customer Churn Prediction, Sentiment Analysis, Document Automation, Recommendation Engines).
Details per use case: Problem it solves, typical value proposition, required data types, common AI techniques used, example success metrics, relevant case studies (yours preferably).
Solution Mapping Engine (Suggestion Tool): Based on inputs from the Discovery module (industry, function, pain points), the tool suggests potentially relevant AI use cases from the library.
"Art of the Possible" Showcase: Curated examples, short videos, or simplified demos illustrating the potential impact of AI in relatable contexts.
Brainstorming Canvas: A digital whiteboard or structured template for collaborative ideation sessions with the client.
Use Case Qualification & Prioritization Module:
Feasibility Assessment Checklist:
Data Readiness: Questions about data availability, accessibility, volume, quality, format, privacy/compliance constraints (CRITICAL for AI).
Technical Viability: Basic assessment of integration points, existing infrastructure, technical expertise required vs. available client-side.
Organizational Readiness: Questions about stakeholder buy-in, change management considerations, potential impact on existing roles/workflows.
Value & Impact Estimator:
Framework to estimate potential ROI (e.g., cost savings, revenue uplift, efficiency gains, risk reduction).
Prompts to define clear, measurable success metrics (KPIs) for the proposed use case.
Alignment Score: Assesses how well the use case aligns with:
Client's strategic priorities.
Your company's core competencies and service offerings.
Prioritization Matrix: A tool (e.g., Value vs. Effort matrix) to help rank multiple identified use cases based on qualification criteria.
Use Case Definition & Scoping Module:
Standardized Use Case Template: A structured format to clearly define the selected use case(s):
Problem Statement (Concise)
Proposed AI Solution (High-level description)
Key Objectives & Success Metrics (Quantifiable)
Required Data Inputs (Sources, types, availability status)
Expected Outputs & Actions
Key Stakeholders (Business & Technical)
High-Level Scope (Inclusions & Exclusions)
Potential Risks & Dependencies
Estimated Impact/Value
Collaboration Features: Ability to share specific use case definitions with clients or internal teams for review and feedback.
Version Control: Track changes to the use case definition as discussions evolve.
Resource & Knowledge Base Integration:
Internal Case Study Links: Direct links from the Use Case Library to relevant, anonymized (or public) case studies showcasing your past successes.
Subject Matter Expert (SME) Directory: Quick lookup for internal experts based on AI technique, industry, or use case type.
Glossary of AI Terms: Simple explanations of relevant AI/ML terminology for both sales reps and clients.
Data Assessment Guides: Simplified guides on common data requirements for different types of AI models.
Output & Reporting:
Use Case Summary Report: Generates a concise summary document for client review or internal handover (e.g., to solution architecture or delivery teams).
Qualification Scorecard: Visual representation of the feasibility, value, and alignment scores.
CRM Integration: Ability to push key information (identified use cases, qualification status, key contacts) to the company's CRM system (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot).
